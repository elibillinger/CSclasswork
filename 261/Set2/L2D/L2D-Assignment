Rock Paper Scissors Part III
At the end of Lab2C, our program looked like follows:

Welcome one and all to a round of Rock, Paper, Scissors! (Enter P, R or S)
Player one: p

Player choose Paper
Computer choose Rock
The final step of our game is to determine who actually won. This handy chart will be your guide.

Add a final line of output that prints a line following this pattern:

X beats Y. Z wins!
Where X and Y are one of "rock" or "scissors" or "paper" and Z is either "Human" or "Computer". Be sure to handle ties appropriately too. And now, we have a fully functioning Rock, Paper, Scissors game! Great job!

Extra Credit! Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
For extra credit, expand your program to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. Feel free to practice a few games to fully understand what beats what. Below is the logic. You will notice there are more ways to win or lose and a smaller possibility to tie.
