1. The issue with $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] is that a script can be added to teh end of the url that it reutrns and that would run that potentially harmful script.
To prevent it you should use htmlspecialchars() to convert it to html so a script cannot be added to the end of the url.
2. Server side validation is needed in order to protect the database from invalid data from being entered that could mess up parts that use the data from the database.
It is good to have both client and server side validation in order to prevent any wrong inputs from teh client not filling something out and protecting the database.
