    Memory Game
Problem Description:
    The program I will be creating will be a memory game. The game is a
    bunch of cards laid out on the screen. All of the different cards are stored on a file which is read
    to make the table. The program will randomize the cards in a grid pattern. The user will select
    two cards using coordinates to see if they match and continue picking two cards until they find
    all of the matching ones. The program will show the cards to the user and keep them shown if they are matching.
    It is text based and uses user text inputs to run.
Program Documentation:
    In order to run the program first they must but in Y to start the game and say you completed the instructions.
    Then they enter coordinates in the form of letter than number i.e. (A1). It will prompt the user for the coordinate
    of the two cards separately.
    More Features could have been having the table be able to be different sizes every game and Allowing the user to add
    symbols for the different cards.
Tests:
    Test for Instruction Read:
    'Y', 'y', 'n', 'H'
    Tests for Coordinates:
    'A1','a2','C5','F4','f4','B&','/3'
    Tests for Restart:
    'Y','y','n','T'
Reflections:
    From this I learned a lot about using different functions in classes and combining classes together. Some difficulties
    occured when trying to get it to check if the game has been won. One difficult part was checking if the strings were valid.
    I learned that the location of where I call functions is important since it would keep outputing the grid even if there was
    a non valid coordinate.
