Python Lab 3B: Life's Two Certainties
Due Thurs, Sept 12th, by 11:45pm
Introduction
This lab, as well as Lab 3A, are due to Canvas by 11:45pm on Sept 12th (latest). You will submit each lab separately, as a single .py file.

To get started, open IDLE and then create a New File via the File menu. We suggest you immediately save this file in some directory you create that will manage all your Python Labs this semester (e.g., CSCI101/PythonLabs). Save this file as Lab3B-DeathAndTaxes.py.
Assignment
Time to write some if statements!

Your program should (1) ask the user to input two variables (filing status and income), (2) output the integer that indicates the tax amount due in USD for that given filing status and income (according to the 2017 tax bracket table below), and (3) output the percent of income paid in taxes as a float (with two decimal places).

Important: For the filing status, please have your program assume the INPUT listed in the table in parentheses. (For example, the user should type in "joint" as the input for the married filing jointly or widow column, not "married-joint-widow".)

Tax

(single)	Married filing jointly

10%	Up to $9,325	Up to $18,650	Up to $9,325	Up to $13,350
15%	$9,326 -

35%	$416,701 -
$418,400	$416,701 - $470,700	$208,351 - $235,350	$416,701 -
$444,500
39.6%	$418,401+	$470,701+	$235,351+	$444,501+

IMPORTANT: money earned inside a particular bracket is taxed at that tax rate. For example, an individual filing as single with an income of $50000 does not pay 25% on the $50000. Rather, the individual pays:
10% on the first $9325 (tax = $932.5)
15% on the next $37950 - $9325 = $28625 (tax = $4293.75)
25% on the remaining $50000 - $37950 = $12050 (tax = $3012.5)
Thus, this individual with the filing status of single has an estimated tax of 932.5 + 4293.75 + 3012.5 = $8238.75, or $8238 as an integer.

When you convert the tax to an integer, we suggest you use type conversion (which will round down). You should convert to an integer after you have calculated the individual's tax.

Lab I/O Format
Throughout this semester we will use a specific Lab Input/Output Format. This format is described below:
When prompting for input, use the prompt string WORD>, where WORD is a single, uppercase word which describes the input. For example, this lab you might choose: STATUS> and INCOME>
When providing output that will be graded, start the line with OUTPUT. Think of this as "boxing your answer" on a math worksheet; it lets us quickly find your answer. Our grading script will skip any output lines that do not start with OUTPUT.
You are welcome (and should!) have other output lines that do not begin with OUTPUT; while our grading script will ignore these, good programmers include print statements that are informational to the user of the program.

Example Execution:
Please enter the filing status:
STATUS> single
Please enter the income earned:
INCOME> 50000
The tax owed by this person (single filing status) with 50000 income is 8238
OUTPUT 8238
The percent of income paid in taxes is 16.48
OUTPUT 16.48

Comments
All Python files submitted to Canvas should include a header with your name, section, and assignment info. These details should be WITHIN the file you upload to Canvas. Submissions without this header will lose 1 point. Here's an example:
        #   Tracy Camp
        #  ​CSCI 101 – Section C
        #   Python Lab 3B
Submission
Once you are satisfied with your solution to this lab, you need to submit the file to Canvas. In Canvas, go to Assignments > Lab3B and upload Lab3B-DeathAndTaxes.py.

Note: this lab is worth 10 points. To receive full credit, your code must execute in Python 3, and you must submit a single file (your Python code file).

Whenever you submit something to Canvas, we strongly recommend you always double check what you submitted actually got submitted correctly (e.g., did the file upload correctly? did you submit the correct file? etc.) If your submission is incorrect, it's on you.
