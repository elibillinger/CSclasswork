Python Lab 1A: Your Initials!
Due Thurs, August 29th, by 11:45pm
Introduction
Welcome to your first Python lab in CSCI 101! This lab, as well as Lab 1B, will be due to Canvas by 11:45pm on August 29th. You will submit each lab separately, as a single .py file.

To get started, open IDLE and then create a New File via the File menu. We suggest you immediately save this file in some directory you create that your will use to store/manage all your Python Labs this semester (e.g., CSCI101/PythonLabs). Save this file as Lab1A-Initials.py.
Assignment
Section 14.5 in your zyBook talks about ASCII Art. Your goal in this lab is to introduce yourself, and then print your initials using ASCII Art. Here is a simple example:
 Hello! My name is Tracy Camp, and my initials are: 

 ******* *******
    *    *
    *    *
    *    *
    *    *******  

Goodbye! 
  
Note the blank lines before and after the ASCII Art, to set off the initials on the screen. Again, save your Python code in the file Lab1A-Initials.py.

We encourage you to be way more creative than this simple example! In fact, we will give a prize to the student with the best ASCII Art showing their initials in each section.

For 102 students: normally you'll want to complete the CSCI 102 labs before the CSCI 101 labs. That is not needed for this lab.

For the advanced Python student: challenge yourself by using loops to print certain parts of your initials.
Comments
All Python files submitted to Canvas should include a header with your name, section, and assignment info. Submissions without this header will lose 1 point. Here's an example:
        #   Tracy Camp
        #  ​CSCI 101 – Section E
        #   Python Lab 1A
Submission
Once you are satisfied with your solution to this lab, you need to submit the file to Canvas. In Canvas, go to Assignments > Lab1A and upload Lab1A-Initials.py.

Whenever you submit something to Canvas, we strongly recommend you always double check what you submitted actually got submitted correctly (e.g., did the file upload correctly? did you submit the correct file? etc.) If your submission is incorrect, it's on you.

Note: this lab is worth 1 point.
