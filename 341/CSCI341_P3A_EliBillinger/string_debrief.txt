1. Eli Billinger CSCI341 Program 3A 10/22/2020
2.I spent about 4 hours on this assignment.
3.I started assignemtn by creating all of parts in main and then created one procedure at a time and checking it before moving on to the next procedure.
I used the debugger to watch values to resolve issues.
4.To solve this problem I used the Green Card and the David Loves Programming links provided under resources in the assignment write up.
The links helped me figure out how to create the rotate procedure when I did not know where to start.
5. I am sure that some of the procedures can be written to be more efficent than they currently are.
6. I am most pleased that the rotate procedure works correctly.
7. To test that the program works correctly I tested many different values. To test the replace feature I inputed the work Hello and had it replace
the l's with m's and that worked corecctly. Then to test the rotate I first tested different integers with strings to make sure that part was correct. I used the integers
of 0 with hello and got hello, 1 with z and got a, 1 with Z and got A, and 28 with Hello and got Jgnnq which was the same as using 2 with Hello.
I also testing invalid characters in the string such as ^,"= and those characters did not change. To test atoi I used 123 to test a positive integer and 1A2 to test a negative
integer and they gave the expected results of 123 and -2.
