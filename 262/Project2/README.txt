2. A challenge that I faced was that my function that checked if a board if valid was not working.
Initially I had two seperate if statements that would check if the number of o's was bigger and the other would
check if teh number of x's compared to o's was equal to 1 or equal to the number of x's. These would not filter out any of the boards.
After using cout statements to find teh problem I found out that any invalid boards for one of the if statements would be validated
by the other one. That is when I realized I needed to nest the if statements to solve this issue.
3. I liked how this problem had us complete it steps, for example having us generate them all then filter.
I disliked how the write up for did not have any hints for how to generate the boards.
4. I spent about 6 hours on this assignment.
