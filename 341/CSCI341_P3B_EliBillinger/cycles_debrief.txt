1. Eli Billinger CSCI 341 Program 3B 11/2/2020
2. I spent about 5 hours on this assignment.
3. To solve this problem I created this program in steps by making the loop of asking input, then adding those to an array, then making tostring, then longest , then overhead, and at the end making it all loop until a negative number is entered.
This approach did not change at any point while I was working on this problem. To solve issues I used the debugger to find the issue.
4. I needed help with how to make an array and access values for an array in MIPS. I used the sources in the write up for this assignment and  this website http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~smoler/cs354/onyourown/arrays.html
5. All parts of my program work and I don't think any of it could use improvement.
6. I am most pleased that overhead works correctly since it was the most difficult part of this assignment.
7. My code follows the procedure calling conventions since the procedures all arguments are saved in a0 for the procedure and the returned values are saved in v0.
Also all of the callee only procedures use $s0-$s7, while the other procedure which is both used $t0-$t9 for its values.
