2. One challenge I faced was with the dynamic outputting a zero cost for paths that had the lowest cost going 2 different paths. I had to write what my code was doing by hand until I figured out that was the problem.
Another challenge I faced was I was putting the value for the loop in the wrong spot in my function call to color the paths. I also fixed this challenge by writing my code out by hand using a smaller data set.
3. I liked how this part of the project was a build on to the first part that made it faster. I disliked how little information about dynamic programming was given and how we had to figure out how to change our recursive code to be dynamic.
4. I spent about 6 hours on this assignment.
