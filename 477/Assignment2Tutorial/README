Overall I thought that this game was cool and easier than I thought it would be to implement. I thought that the first game would be a lot more basic than the one I did which was really cool. This game uses the arrow keys and left mouse to move and shoot at enemies as they spawn and try to kill you. It is pretty fun to play and taught a lot of cool features like spawners and collision.
