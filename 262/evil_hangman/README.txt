2. A challenge I had in this project was figuring how to generate the word families and save them to a map. After a couple of failed attempts I went to a blank project and tested using the example in the write up. This allowed for easier testing and fixing which helped me figure out my issues.
3. I liked how this assignment had us use the data structures we have learned and create a cool and interesting project from it. I did not dislike any part of this assignment.
4.I spent 5 hours on this assignment.
